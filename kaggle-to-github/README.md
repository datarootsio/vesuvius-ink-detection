# kaggle-to-github
The kaggle-to-github.sh script allows you to download kaggle kernels to the dataroots.io organization.\ 
If you want to push kaggle kernels to your private repository, you can do this directly in your kaggle notebook ([here](https://www.kaggle.com/product-feedback/295170)) 

How to use the script:

``` bash kaggle-to-github.sh {Kaggle Kenral} {Kaggle Dataset} {Github Repo} ```

Example :\

``` bash kaggle-to-github.sh kaggle_to_github vesuvius-challenge-ink-detection vesuvius-ink-detection ```
